# PicoPlaca
Using the language that you feel most proficient in, weâ€™d like you to write a "Pico y Placa" predictor. The inputs should be a license plate number (the full number, not the last digit), a date (as a String), and a time, and the program will return whether or not that car can be on the road. You may use any input and output method you prefer.

Note: To develop this application you need to consider the past rules of the Pico&Placa. (Hours: 7:00am - 9:30am / 16:00pm - 19:30). Additional research would be needed to complete the exercise.

Application:

When an user inputs all the correct information it should display a screen where it tells him whether he can be on the road or not, also it lets him know how much time left does he have to wait until the next Pico Hour starts or when does it end.
