# PicoPlaca
Using the language that you feel most proficient in, weâ€™d like you to write a "Pico y Placa" predictor. The inputs should be a license plate number (the full number, not the last digit), a date (as a String), and a time, and the program will return whether or not that car can be on the road. You may use any input and output method you prefer.
